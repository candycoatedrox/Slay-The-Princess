# Slay the Princess - Java Adaptation

An adaptation of Black Tabby Games' [*Slay the Princess*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1989270/Slay_the_Princess__The_Pristine_Cut/?curator_clanid=40475861) as a text-based adventure game, written entirely in Java.

Currently, all Chapter IIs and most Chapter IIIs are fully implemented, and the player can claim five vessels. The finale has not yet been implemented.

## Back-end
The architecture diagram and a map of all routes in the game can be found [here](https://viewer.diagrams.net/?tags=%7B%7D&lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=CSC120%20Final%20Project%20Architecture.drawio&dark=auto#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1EUzs4jco-MmQYJOuMJLUEatxQLkz1VDW%26export%3Ddownload). The link contains:
1. The architecture diagram
2. A full-game route map
3. A route map of only Chapter I: The Hero and the Princess
4. A simplified full-game route map

(The route map isn't completely finished yet; all Chapter IIIs and Chapter II: The Adversary are currently unfinished.)
