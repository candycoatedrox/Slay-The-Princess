p I am a growing chorus of contradiction. A mass of tides ebbing and flowing all at once in more directions than my attention can bear to hold. To look at any one is to shift them all into something new, and to look away is to reshape them yet again.
p All of me is changing, and yet the rest of me is still the same.

label noExist
p And yet my waters flow and my streets bustle. There are no words that can describe me into non-existence. There is no logic that can bind my multitudes.
p I am everything that you have known me to be, but I am also none of it.

label how
p As easily as you can stand to be you. You are like me, even if you have chosen not to look at the corners of you that do not fit, even if you have chosen to ignore the brilliant contours of your soul.

label worse
p It changes me, but it doesn't make me worse, nor does it make me care for you any less. Does it make you worse? Do you resent me?

label moreWorse
p It says that your heart is gentle. That even in the darkness, you are guided by compassion.

label distantWorse
p It does seem small from here. And the more we journey, the smaller each of those steps will be. But that doesn't make any of them less special.

label mehWorse
p How strange of you to ask me, then.

label stopWorse
p It will, in time. But you still have a ways to go before we are done. Know that I hold no malice for you.

    p If that remains your choice when all is said and done, then you may try. But know that I do not wish you harm, even if you attempt to destroy me. /// check
    p If that remains your choice when all is said and done, then you may try. I will regret destroying you, if that is what we come to. /// checkfalse

label worlds
p My perspectives are shadowed. You have seen what I have seen, just as I have seen what you have seen. The angles of my vantage do not offer me hidden truths, and my attention is turned inward, except when you are here with me.
p Perhaps this will change when our work is done.

label want
    p The desires of my multitude thrive in endless competition with themselves, but none of them rise above their dance to influence me. /// check
        p I yearn for what I have always yearned for. Our awakening. Other desires shrink in the light of knowing you and knowing me. /// check

    p I care about your gifts, but I have no preferences to burden you with. Even if I did, I would never dare to tarnish our relationship by assuming myself above you. /// check

label preferences
p The tides do not dictate where they are pulled. A river does not dictate its outlets.
