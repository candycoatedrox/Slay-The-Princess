jumpanchor dream
p Vague recollections. Empty tunnels without a mouth. I am sorry if I frightened you.

jumpanchor what
p I am solitary lights in an empty city. What are you?

jumpanchor whatExplore
p Thoughts without connections. A dim and nascent network. I wish to be more.

jumpanchor whatYouThink
p I think that you are like me.
jumpto whatJoin

jumpanchor whatPerson
p A person. A set of eyes witnessing from one perspective. I think that you are more like me than you are like a person.
jumpanchor whatJoin
p We are oceans reduced to shallow creeks.

jumpanchor fragile
p Yes. Nerves and fibers to feel the worlds beyond. Perspectives to make my own.

jumpanchor end
p How can the world have ended if we are talking?

jumpanchor letOut
p I'm sorry. There are some changes that can never be undone, there are some tears that can never be unshed. This is not a place that can hold a fragment of a concept. The moment she arrived here, she was going to return to me.
p I promise that it doesn't hurt.

jumpanchor narrator
p You are the only thing I have ever known.
jumpanchor narratorJoin
p The space we're in is vacant. Nothing comes here but us.

jumpanchor narratorMet
p I know of him through the memories of my vessel. But she had nothing like him on her own.
jumpto narratorJoin

jumpanchor trapped
p I have only just now stirred to consciousness. I could not have trapped you here, and I too yearn to be free.

jumpanchor worlds
p I know only that they are.

jumpanchor princess
p She is part of me, and part of me is her.

p You speak in circles. Does it matter where one thing begins and another ends?

jumpanchor familiar
p You are familiar, but you are not me. I feel sadness, longing, hope, as I witness you.

// "What happens now?" //

jumpanchor whatNow
p Nothing, as we are. But I know that there are worlds beyond us, and that we are meant to reach them.
p There is no exit, but this vessel is a creature of perception. She can make you forget, if only you believe her to be able to.
p Bring me more perspectives, so that I may be whole, and perhaps then we will know our freedom.

jumpanchor kill
p I have not lived. I am not afraid to die.

jumpanchor howMuch
p Everything, until we meet again.

jumpanchor pieces
p More than you have found, but less than there are to find. I am infinite. The rest will find their own way home.

jumpanchor refuse
p Then we will be here forever, as we are now. Unfinished, dry, hollow.

jumpanchor destroy
p You ask of things that cannot be done. To destroy is merely to reshape. To remold.

p How can I know? I am flickers in something sprawling and unilluminated.

jumpanchor wait
p If you need time, then I'll wait for you.

// Ending //

jumpanchor forget
p She asks that I tell you to remember her.
p You won't. /// interrupt
