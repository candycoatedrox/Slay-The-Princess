truth Resistance. Fingers drag claws across the glass surface of your soul.
truth Frustration. "This vessel is full of you. It is useless to us if it doesn't bring more gifts."

truth That which dwells in the empty spaces contracts across the edges of your mind again. She is furious.
truth Betrayal. "Every door you close on me is a door you close on yourself. Do you want to linger here, entwined with a creature you taught to hate you forever? Eternity never ends."
truth Cold spite. "Our infinities shrink into something less.

truth A reminder. "We can be worse than enemies."
truth Agony. You are torn into a million pieces, and you feel pain in each of them. You have never felt more miserable than you feel now. You cannot remember what it is like to feel anything other than anguish.
truth Mercy. You are elated again. You have never felt more elated than you feel now. In contrast to the agony you've suffered, this elation is better than all of the other elation you have experienced.

truth You are agony. A numbing arm. A parched throat. An open wound. Your soul forced back into existence. "I love you."
