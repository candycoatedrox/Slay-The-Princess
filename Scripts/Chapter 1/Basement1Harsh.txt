p That would be fine. I can lose an arm.

p Well, you do have that big sharp knife. You could always cut me out of here.

n She speaks with almost complete nonchalance.
hero If *we* were stuck down here for long enough, I'm sure we'd be nonchalant about cutting our way out. Anything to finally be free.

n You attempt to make your way out of the basement, but the door at the top of the stairs slams shut. You hear the click of a lock sliding into place.
hero Is someone else here?

label rescueStairsShoutA
n Your shouts and pleas are met with silence.
n You're here to slay the Princess, and you won't leave until the task is done.

label rescueStairsShoutB
n Your shouts and pleas are met with silence.

label rescueStairsTryAgain
n You try the door again. It's still locked.

label rescueReturn
n You make your way back to the bottom of the stairs. This would have been so much easier if you'd simply slain her like you were supposed to.
hero Easier for whom?
n Easier for *everyone.*
linebreak
p I heard the door slam... they locked you down here too, didn't they?
p The knife. Pick it up and cut me out of here.
n You what like what happens if you do that...

label rescueSave
n Against your better judgment, you place the blade against the Princess's arm, just above the massive, unyielding chain.
n You cut into her flesh.
n The blade is sharp, and you make quick work of it. Before long, you're able to crack through bone, and she pulls the bleeding stub of her arm through the iron gauntlet.
hero She didn't so much as utter a sound...
n Free from her bindings, the Princess turns to face you, her fierce gaze meeting your eye.
hero How is she so composed after losing an arm? It's like she isn't even bothered by it.
p Thank you. Now let's get out of here.

n No. We won't have any of that. The stakes are too high. You can't just let her escape into the world.
n ... no. *I* can't just let her escape into the world.
n As the Princess approaches the bottom stair, your body steps forward and raises the blade.
hero Wait... this isn't fair. You can't just *do* that!
n Watch me.

n Stop that.
n I thought this was a little too easy.
n Your body lunges forward to sink the blade into her back, but the Princess swiftly moves out the way before you can connect.
n Stop it! Stop trying to resist me! I'm *trying* to get you out of here alive.

n The blade! Move. The. *Blade!*
p You're doing your best to help me, aren't you? I can see the conflict in your eyes.
p I'll make this quick.
n She steps forward and pries the blade from your rigid hands.
p Maybe I'll see you in another life.
n And then she slits your throat with an almost clinical ease.
n Her face remains unchanged as she watches you collapse to the ground, blood flowing from your butchered neck.
hero This is the end, isn't it?
linebreak
n I'm afraid it is. Everything goes dark, and you die. I hope it was worth it.

label rescueControlledSlay1
n You bring the blade down and plunge it into the Princess's back. *Finally.*
hero Okay. There's no going back now.
n Though the blade left a deep gash in her shoulder, she barely so much as flinches, turning around to stare at you incredulously.
p Are you serious?
p I don't know what came over you, but if we're doing this, I guess I'll have to kill you.
p Do you think I need both of my arms to do that? I can beat you to death with one.
p But I don't have to tell you that. I'll go ahead and show you.

label rescueControlledSlayGiveUp
n *Sigh.* As the blade falls from your trembling hands, the Princess rears back, readying a bone-shattering haymaker.
n You fall to your knees. You're barely able to process the ringing in your ears before she hits you again.
n Every blow is as punishing as the first. You feel bones shatter with every impact, unknown ruptures blossoming with blood somewhere inside of you.
n If we're lucky, the wound you managed to inflict will be enough to at least delay her escape from this place. If we're very lucky, it will kill her before she gets out.
p Too weak to even try fighting back. How disappointing.

n *Thank* you.
n You swing your arm towards her throat, the blade singing through the air.
n But she's ready for it. She grabs your arm, her grip like a stone vice.
n You drop the blade. Pathetically.
n She lets go, and faster than you can react, rears back and hits you with a bone-shattering haymaker.
n There's a ringing in your ears. You're fairly certain you can feel bone grinding against bone where she fractured your jaw, but your body isn't allowing you to feel much right now, adrenaline coursing through your system and numbing your nerves.
n You fall to your knees. You're barely able to bring your trembling arms up to defend yourself before she hits you again.
n Every blow is as punishing as the first. You feel bones shatter with every impact, unknown ruptures blossoming with blood somewhere inside of you.

n She places a confident heel on your chest and pushes you down to the ground.
n Her knee falls to your throat, your windpipe crushed beneath a weight you didn't think her slight form could possibly possess.
hero It can't just end like this, right?
n I'm sorry, but it's over.
linebreak
n Everything goes dark, and you die.

label rescueSlay
n Without hesitation, you bring the blade down. The Princess flinches as you strike, and your weapon sinks into her shoulder.
p You bastard! If I have to kill you to leave this place, I'll *do it.*
hero I thought we had the upper hand, but it's as if she's barely even threatened by us.
n It's an act. She's unarmed and there's nothing she can do to hurt you.
hero I'm not so sure...
n Don't waver now.
n As you raise your blade to strike again, she kicks out, knocking your legs out from under you.
n The two of you struggle on the ground. You lash out with the blade, slicing wherever you can. Her fists connect with your body again and again, each blow stronger than the last, shattering bone and rupturing tissue with reckless abandon.
hero Forget trying to rescue her. This is about *survival* now. Give her everything you've got.

n You roll out of her grasp and shakily push yourself back to your feet.
n Though every inch of you is in pain, the Princess probably has it worse -- blood pours out from countless gashes, staining her once pristine dress. She pauses for a moment, catching her breath, staring at you with wild eyes.
hero We can still turn this around.

label commitTowerRescueB
n Are you serious? *Sigh.* As the force of her blows overwhelms your body, the blade falls from your trembling hands, clattering uselessly to the cobblestones below. I suppose you just lacked the will to finish the job.
n The Princess, wounded but still alive, turns to face you.
n She places a confident heel on your chest, and pushes you to the ground.
n Her knee slides to your throat and your windpipe is crushed under weight you didn't think her frame could possibly possess.
p Pathetic.
hero This is the end, isn't it?
linebreak
n Everything goes dark, and you die.

label commitAdversaryRescue
n You steel your resolve and take another step towards the Princess. You probably won't make it out of here alive, but you can at least make sure she won't make it out of here, either.
hero Excuse me? What was that about not making it out of here alive?
n Do you think this is what I wanted to happen? I have a duty to state the facts of the situation, and honestly, it's a miracle *anyone* is still standing right now.
n Can you not feel all those ruptured organs bouncing around in there? If the Princess doesn't do our friend in herself, internal bleeding is certain to finish the job.
linebreak
n The two of you clash for the final time. You feel your ribs break as she delivers a heavy blow, but you push through the pain, falling forward and sinking your blade deep into the Princess's heart.
p O... oh.
p This was fun. You put up more of a fight than I thought you would. But I have to wonder...
p Do you *really* think this is the end?
n But you don't have time to worry over her words.
linebreak
n Everything goes dark, and you die.

label rescueFlee
n The Princess is still chained to the wall. There's nothing she can do to stop you from getting out of here.
hero What if she doesn't succumb to her wounds? Whatever she is, she's *so* much more dangerous than I thought she'd be.
linebreak
n You rush up the stairs and dive past the threshold. You're safe. For now.
