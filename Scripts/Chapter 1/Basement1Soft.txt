hero She has a point. We're talking like this for a reason.
p So this shouldn't be about what I'd do if I got out of here, or me saying the right thing to convince you to save me...
p This is about how *messed up* this whole situation is! This is my life we're talking about!
p Do you really think I can even end the world? Why would I even want to?
p We both know that if there's people we can't trust in this situation, it's whoever locked me down here, and it's whoever sent you here. And those two groups are probably one and the same.
n Don't let her turn the tables here. This isn't about trust. This is about *risk.* We stand to lose everything, all for the sake of one person. And a subjugating *monarch,* no less.
