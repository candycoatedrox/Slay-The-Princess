n You're on a path in the woods. And at the end of that path is a cabin. And in the basement of that cabin is a princess.
n You're here to slay her. If you don't, it will be the end of the world.

// First menu //

label dejaVu
n A terrible sense of deja vu? No, you don't have that. This is the first time either of us have been here.

label dejaVu2
n We could go back and forth on this forever, and it won't get you any closer to doing your job and saving the world. So let's just agree to disagree.

label happened
n It hasn't. Or if it has, I certainly haven't been a part of it. We've just met for the first time, you and I.

label no
n Oh, don't you start grandstanding about morals. The fate of the world is at risk right now, and the life of a mere Princess shouldn't stop you from saving us all.

label died
n I can assure you that you're not dead. And to answer your second question, you're here to slay the Princess. I literally told you that a second ago.

label killedSelf
n I can assure you that you're not dead. And to answer your second question, you're here to slay the Princess. I literally told you that a second ago.

label alreadyKilled
n I can assure you that you didn't.

label trapped
n How unfortunate that the sole person capable of slaying the Princess also seems to be somewhat insane. Oh, well. So long as you get the job done, it doesn't matter what sort of mental state you're in.

label killMe
n Again? People don't die twice. You haven't even met the Princess, and I hardly think she'd be capable of killing someone as skilled and courageous as yourself.

label slewHer
n I can assure you that you didn't slay her, and that she didn't kill you. People don't just spring back to life after dying, and the two of us are meeting for the very first time.

label wise
n My tricks? What on earth are you talking about? We've just met for the first time.

// Hypothetical //

label assume
n Those are two *very* different questions, but fine. I'll indulge you if that's what it takes to get you moving.
n Let's say for a moment that this really is the second time you've met me, or, at least, a version of me.
    jumpto assumeShareDied /// check
n If you're back here, I'm assuming you died, which probably only happened because you didn't listen to me.

label assumeShareDied
n You died last time, which probably only happened because you didn't listen to me.

label assumePointA
n Anyways, I believe your other question was something along the lines of "ohhh, what's the point of doing anything?" If you're asking that, it sounds to me like you're making the rather dangerous assumption that your actions last time around didn't have any consequences.

label assumePointB
n And I believe your other question was something along the lines of "ohhh, what's the point of doing anything?" If you're asking that, it sounds to me like you're making the rather dangerous assumption that your actions last time around didn't have any consequences.

para Speak for yourself. From my perspective there were plenty of consequences. I'm never going forget the way she just made us *stop working.*
n And that's only scratching the surface. If what you said is true, it begs the question of *how* you got back here. Did "time" simply rewind itself, or have you found yourself in another world altogether? If it's the latter, what do you think happened *after* you died?

jumpto consequenceFree2Died

label consequenceFree2Slain
n Yes, but, in this purely hypothetical scenario, that begs the question of *how* you got back here. Did "time" simply rewind itself, or have you found yourself in another world altogether?
n Had you failed to slay the Princess, what would have happened to everyone in the place you left?

label consequenceFree2Died
n Yes, but, in this purely hypothetical scenario, that begs the question of *how* you got back here. Did "time" simply rewind itself, or have you found yourself in another world altogether?
n If it's the latter, what do you think happened *after* you died?
label consequenceFree2LateJoin
n Do you think the people there lived happily ever after, or do you think that the Princess, left unhindered, brought about the end to everyone and everything, just like I told you she would?

label defy
hero That's right. You can't stop all of us.
smitten We're going to sweep her off her feet if it's the last thing anyone does.
n Are these really the sorts of people you'd like to align yourself with? *Sigh.* You're not at the cabin yet. You still have plenty of time to reflect on the situation. I just hope for all our sakes that you make the right call.

label askPrincess
n Just be quick about it.

label princessTips
n Like I said, if she killed you, it was probably because you didn't listen to me. Don't talk to her. Don't trust her. Just go in, do your job, and save the world.

label princessHowDanger
n She just can. Believe me, I wish I could tell you more, but you'll just have to trust that what I'm saying is true and that, despite it all, you're fully up to the task that's been given to you.

label princessQuote
n She *is* just a Princess. Whatever you think happened to you last time, just get it out of your head before you get to the cabin, and you'll be *fine.*

label princessBasement
n *People* locked her in that basement. And I told you what this place is. It's a path in the woods. Don't overcomplicate things.

label princessWhyMe
n Look, I'm not supposed to say this, but it's because you're special. You're the *only* person capable of doing this. Call it a prophecy if that helps, but it's just the way things are.
hero Oh. I didn't know we were *special.*
n Of course you're special. Why else would you be here?

label princessCagey
n I've told you everything you need to know, going into more detail would just overcomplicate an otherwise very simple situation and make your job more difficult.

label princessCageyArmedInfo
hero If you want us to stand a chance against her, we need to be armed with information. What is she really capable of? How are we supposed to stop her?
label princessCagey2
n Not to sound like a broken record, but the less you know about her, the better things will go for all of us. I know it sounds like I'm hiding something, but you're just going to have to take me at my word.

label princessReturn
n Great. Now if you don't mind, the whole world is waiting with bated breath for you to save it from ruin.

// Hill dialogue //

label hillDialogue
linebreak
truth You emerge into the clearing. The cabin waits at the top of the hill.
n A warning, before you go any further...
n She will lie, she will cheat, and she will do everything in her power to stop you from slaying her. Don't believe a word she says.

// Abort attempt //

label abortStart
n Seriously? You're just going to turn around and leave? Do you even know where you're going?

label abortReturnUgh
n *Thank you!* The whole world owes you a debt of gratitude. Really.

label abortReturnMaybe
n I guess we will.

label abortLie
n Somehow I doubt that, but fine.
n I suppose you just quietly continue down the path away from the cabin.

label abortNihilist
n There won't *be* a "new dawn" if the world ends. There'll just be *nothing.* Forever!

label abortCont
n Fine, I suppose you just quietly continue down the path away from the cabin.

label abortReturnMenu2
n That's great to hear! And as long as you bring that fiery attitude to Princess slaying, I think this will all resolve splendidly.

label abortClearing

truth You emerge into the clearing. The cabin waits at the top of the hill.
n That's strange. It looks like this path also leads to the cabin. How convenient! Everything's back on track again. Maybe the world can still be saved after all.
cold Oh? How quaint. He really wants us to go in there, doesn't He? /// checkvoice

label abortCommit
n You're really keen on wasting everyone's time, aren't you? It's remarkably selfish, if you ask me. I've already outlined the stakes of the situation. If you don't do your job, everyone dies. Like, *dies* dies. Forever.
n But fine. You turn around and trek back down the path you came.

// Ask about the mirror //

n There isn't.

hero *Very* different.
n Maybe that's because you haven't actually been here. I hope this means you'll finally drop that ridiculous past-life nonsense. You haven't died, and you certainly haven't been killed by the Princess.
n So focus up. The world is depending on you.

label stairsLeaveFail
n What? No. You're already halfway down the stairs, you can't just turn around now.
