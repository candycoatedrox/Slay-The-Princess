n You're on a path in the woods -- /// interrupt
hero Mate, we're *clearly* already in the cabin.
n Excuse me? You're clearly... oh. Huh. S-so you are. ... How do you know about the cabin? I didn't get to the cabin part of my opening monologue yet.
hero We've been here before. Well, not *here* here, but I'm sure you know what I'm talking about. You knew about the looping last time.
    skeptic Not that he was eager to *divulge* that. /// checkvoice
    oppo Now, now, He's *clearly* disorientated. I'm sure all this new info is going to come as quite a shock to Him. Best if we're gentle. /// checkvoice
hero And right on cue, here's the new guy. *Welcome!*
    skeptic Can't say I'm happy to be here. /// checkvoice
    oppo Thank you, thank you! I'm just happy to be here. /// checkvoice
n Okay, yes, I get it. You've been here before. That's terrible. You know that, right? Because the only reason you would have been here before is if you failed in whatever world you'd come from. Meaning you doomed an... entire other reality. But I'm sure since you're so well-traveled you know that, yes?
    skeptic We know that you keep *telling* us that, but we've never seen a world end. As far as I'm concerned, that whole conversation is just *noise.* And I'm stuck on a better question. Where's the *other one?* /// checkvoice
        n The... *other* one? /// checkvoice-skeptic
        skeptic Yeah. A certain lovesick fool has been suspiciously quiet. One might even say... *absent.* /// checkvoice
        hero Oh. You're... right. It's a little quiet here, isn't it? Maybe that's... one of the rules. Maybe only one "bonus voice" is allowed to be here at a time. /// checkvoice-skeptic
        skeptic "Bonus voice?" I'm just as important as you are. /// checkvoice
        hero I'm not saying it's a bad thing! All I'm saying is that... it's my third time here, and it's your first. You're not *unwelcome,* but... from my perspective, you're definitely bonus. /// checkvoice-skeptic
    oppo Well, we know that now, thanks to you! We're all so *lucky* to be stuck with... erm, *working with,* someone so well-informed! You can count on us to do things right from here on out. /// checkvoice
n I'm going to describe the room now.
n The interior of the cabin is vast and regal. High-arched windows line the walls, their multicolored glass casting kaleidoscopic patterns across the stone floor. An iron chandelier hangs from the vaulted ceiling, its many candles lit with flickering light, vaguely illuminating the massive room. This is a house fit for royalty.
n Before you, there's... there isn't a blade, is there`? That's not good.

label bladeStart
    skeptic I see your point, but it's still an option that's been taken away from us. I. Don't. *Like* losing options. /// checkvoice
        n Yes, and it's an important one! It's your *implement.* You're going to need it if you want to do this right! And the fact that you're here, right now, *again,* means that you have not yet *done this right!* /// checkvoice-skeptic
    oppo Now that is some *fine* reasoning. Who *cares* about the blade? I think you're right, we're better off without it! It's not like it's ever been *important.* /// checkvoice
        n *Sigh.* Of *course* the blade's important! It's your *implement.* You're going to need it if you want to do this right! And the fact that you're here, right now, *again,* means that you have not yet done this right. /// checkvoice-oppo
hero But it's not there, is it? We don't even get the choice. So... what are we supposed to do?
n I... don't actually know. I'm sure it'll turn up somewhere, i-it has to. It's part of the whole structure of this place, I think. At the very least it's *important.*

label smittenStart
hero Yeah... He was a bit of a loud one, wasn't he? Is he... okay?
oppo We're better off without him, if you ask me. One less opinion we have to contend with. Plus, *he's* the one who got us *into* this whole mess.
n Is that so? Maybe there is hope for you after all, free from the bad influence of your missing friend.

label mirrorStart
    skeptic Oh, I see it. I've just been preoccupied with *everything else* going on. Like the fact that we can *rip our own heart out* without deciding that's what we're going to do! /// checkvoice
        n Is -- that what happened to you last time? How did that even *work?* You'd better not do it again! /// checkvoice-skeptic
        hero Lucky for you, the one who did it is the one who's gone. /// checkvoice-skeptic
        n Wonderful. Moving on, I have no idea what you're talking about. There is no mirror. There's only the stained glass windows, the empty table where your blade *should* be, and the door to the basement. /// checkvoice-skeptic
            hero You said that last time, too, but that hasn't stopped it from showing up again. /// checkvoice-skeptic mirror2
                skeptic Or *moving.* /// checkvoice mirror2

label abortAttemptStart
n As you *foolishly* turn to leave the cabin and *abandon* the world to its ruination, you're...
n Oh! Isn't that convenient? Er, as you turn around, you're faced with a solid wall. There isn't a way out. It would appear that you're stuck here until you find a resolution to our Princess problem.
    skeptic Yes. It's *very* convenient, isn't it? /// checkvoice
        n I assure you, I'm just as surprised as you are. Can't you hear the relief in my voice? I wouldn't be *relieved* if I was the one who set this up. I would have known you were stuck here from the beginning. /// checkvoice-skeptic
    oppo That *is* convenient! Look at us, crossing off a whole avenue of exploration! Figuring out the rest of this is going to be *so much easier* now that we only have one way left to go! /// checkvoice
        n You know, I'm starting to like you. /// checkvoice-oppo
        hero Because he's blowing smoke up your ass? /// checkvoice-oppo
        n Because he's being *reasonable.* /// checkvoice-oppo
n Look, it doesn't matter *who* put that wall there, because it's *there.* The only thing for you to do now is find the Princess, and, ideally, find your weapon while you're at it.
n With nowhere to go but forward, you turn back around, leaving the nonexistent exit behind you.

n If the Princess lives here, slaying her would probably -- Ugh. Agh. No, that doesn't work here at all. This place is nice. It's... *fancy,* even! I have to say, whatever you did in your previous lives, I *deeply dislike* how much it's thrown me off my rhythm.

// The Hall //

label hallStart
n This hall, like the one below, is grand and beautiful. Torches bathe the room in warm, comforting light, just enough to illuminate the tapestries along every wall, woven with scenes of chivalry and courtship and romance. The many cloth eyes are fixed on each other, gazes averted from the long table in the center of the room, the Princess seated at its far end.
n Your pristine blade glints in the weak torchlight, hanging from a golden chain around the Princess's neck.
n So *that's* where it is! And the tip is already pointed right at her heart! Okay. Everything is falling back into place. All you have to do is cross the room, push down a little, and the entire world is saved! That's easy!
    skeptic Isn't that... *suspiciously* easy? There has to be a twist. There has to be something *waiting* for us. You saw what happened to her last time, she's NOT what she seems. /// checkvoice
    oppo Yeah! That *is* easy, isn't it? So... where's the rush? /// checkvoice
p You're here`! Now we can start being happy together`. Why don't you sit down`? Wouldn't that be nice?

n You begin to feast, and the Princess follows suit, her soft smile never fading.
n The food is more exquisite than you ever could have imagined. You sample countless otherworldly dishes, sauces and bread and hearty stews whose tastes dance across your tongue.
n You tear at hunks of meat practically melting from the bone, juicy and tender and bursting with flavors you could scarcely begin to describe. Your cup fills itself again and again with a flowery nectar so sweet it tastes like glimmering jewels.
hero This really is perfect, isn't it?
n It is the best meal you've ever had.
n But then it's over`. And you're just as hungry as when you began.
p Wasn't that perfect? We should do it again.

n The shadow washes across the table, clearing and replating. The feast is once again laid before you.
n The food is good, again. You tear into golden, crispy flesh, dab at the slurry of aromatic sauces on your plate with thick-crusted bread, sip your goblet of sparkling gems. But you have done this already.
    oppo A good meal is still a good meal. And we didn't even have to clear the dishes! I'm happy. /// checkvoice

linebreak
n And so the shadow sweeps over the table, clearing the old and laying out the new`. And so, you do it again.
n The meat is fine. The bread is... fine. You sample the side dishes, and they're fine, too. You finish your goblet, the liquid within no longer glimmering on your palate, instead leaving your mouth coated in a... tacky film. You put it down, and it fills again. You... do not drink more.

linebreak
n Again, the shadow replaces your feast`, and again you eat.
n The meat is... greasy`. The bread is tough, its crust hurting your jaw as you chew`. The grey vegetables are... barely worth the effort of picking through`. You don't even touch the goblet, its sickly sweet aroma utterly unappealing.

The tension between turns, the triumphant highs of moves well placed, and the tragic lows of miscalculations and careless plays. The warmth of trust and the cool texture of deception. And then, the climax, as she places her final piece...

n The shadow descends on the board once again. More pieces are added, their shapes more intricate, their purposes less immediately clear. And the two of you set about discovering the complexities of the game anew.
n And so you do, and it is fun again. In fact, it's *almost* as fun as the first time you played, and the sputtering torch roars back to life.
n But then you get used to the additions`, and the feeling starts to fade`, a creeping numbness settling in over the board.
n More pieces are added`. The feelings flare`. The feelings... fade. The Princess suggests new rules. A glimmer of what could have been excitement flits through your mind`, quickly vanishing as the game progresses`. Your pieces advance in an ever-increasing slog to their destination.
n Winning and losing become nothing but ends`, and even the end becomes nothing as you roll over into a new game, the board resetting as many times as you can finish. Until finally...
