hero If He doesn't remember what happened, then maybe it's best to keep it that way.
smitten Yes, He didn't approve of us last time, did He? If we're going to save our beloved, we'll have to be sneaky about it.
hero Our... "beloved?"
n Yes, you'll have to be *very* sneaky about your intentions if you're going to try and save the Princess.
smitten Ah, so all of the cards are on the table. Then you should know that we and the Princess are in love and the four of us will be foiling any and all assassination attempts you've got in the works.
n We'll see about that. Whatever you do, just be sure to ignore *him,* specifically. It sounds like he's the sort who'd sacrifice the whole world for a peck on the cheek.
smitten What can I say? A world without love is a world that isn't worth saving.

jumpanchor assume
smitten *You* were the one who did us in, villain.
hero Well, not you in the literal sense, but you did everything you could to stop us from rescuing her.
n Oh, I wonder why. Maybe it's because the entire world was at stake. No lone Princess is worth that price.
smitten I beg to differ.
n I'm not going to argue with you. I'm just going to take a deep breath and assume that whoever is making the decisions here has the common sense to *ignore* your protestations.

jumpanchor assume2

n Convoluted? I don't know how this premise could be any more simple. Princess bad. Stop her. Save everyone.

smitten Maybe it's her *beauty* that threatens the world.
n Sure. It's her beauty. Why not? And before you ask, no. We can't just keep her down there. If you don't slay her, she's going to find a way out. It's unfortunate, I know, but it's just the way it is.

jumpanchor princessSpecial
smitten Calling us special isn't going to make us friends, even if it did feel nice.

jumpanchor cabinIntro
nowplaying The Damsel
n The interior of the cabin is clean and elegant, its stone walls draped in fine-threaded tapestries, a prison befitting a royal prisoner. The only furniture of note is an ornate wooden table with a pristine blade perched on its edge.
n The blade is your implement. You'll need it if you want to do this right.

jumpanchor cabinDifferent
hero *Very* different.
smitten Is it? I can't say I was paying much attention to the scenery last time around.
n Maybe that's because you haven't actually been here. I hope this means you'll finally drop that ridiculous past-life nonsense. You haven't died, and you certainly haven't been killed by the Princess.
n So focus up. Stop letting yourself get distracted.

truth Her dress is more elaborate than last time, with several layers of ruffles at the bottom, and she wears a more traditional crown in place of her tiara.
smitten My love! We're here to rescue you from your unjust and foul imprisonment!

jumpanchor killed
p I'm sorry! Didn't you want me to?
hero ... Did we?
smitten We warned her of the cruel forces seizing our body. That's practically telling her to kill us. She is our beloved, and she made the choice to free us of our misery, to show us mercy and make the best decision for everyone.
n She made the best decision for her. Don't be so quick to assign kindness, you're just opening yourself up to manipulation.

n What?! No. She's a prisoner here. You can't just slip her hand through the chains!
hero Why are you two arguing over the logistics of slipping her hand out of her shackles? She just said she'd be okay with *any* idea we came up with. Am I the only one here who thinks that's weird?
smitten She didn't care last time! Why should she care this time? That's our stoic, smiling angel.

hero She wasn't confused for long.

jumpanchor sorry

p That's okay! You were just doing your best, and that's all that matters.

smitten That's because she's perfect!
hero Do you think she has someone like Him telling her what to do?
n She doesn't. There's no one else like me.
smitten I think he's right. Because I like it better if she doesn't have some horrid little voice like Him always trying to drive her to violence.

// Rescue her //

jumpanchor rescueStartHowFree
n Rescue her? What are you talking about? Did you forget that she's a world-ending monstrosity? And even if you wanted to unleash her onto the world, despite the complete moral disaster that would be, you'd have to get her out of those chains. Good luck with that!
smitten Don't you see how dainty her hands are? We'll be able to slip her out with ease.
n No! She's a prisoner here. You can't just slip her hand through the chains!
hero If her hands could just slip out of the chains, why hasn't she done it already?
smitten Because we've yet to present her with her freedom.

smitten ... If we just showed her the contents of our heart... she'd be happy here.
n As the voice thinks its thought, your hands raise, fingers pointing towards your chest, and then... what?! No, you absolutely do *not* do that!
smitten Oh, but I do.
hero What. What is he doing? We can't see unless you tell us.
n Are you sure you want to know? *Sigh.* I suppose I can't stall forever.
n You plunge your nails into your chest, digging deep, grasping for a handhold. And you find it, your fingers curling around your ribs.
p Oh no, what are you doing? Are you okay? You can't do that and be okay!
hero Time out! He should not be allowed to do that. He's not the decider.
smitten ... And yet... it's *done,* isn't it?
n It will be soon. You yank violently, your bones cracking with wet pops as you pull yourself apart inch by painful inch.
n Your exposed heart, framed by jagged ribs, thumps rhythmically in your raw, bloodied chest, the loosened... uh, threads? of your body unfurling to cover the surface of the room.
smitten Don't mind my sacrifice, it's a fair price to pay to give her everything she *doesn't know she wants.*
p Oh... I see... you're trying to tell me something...
p It's... beautiful.
n The Princess, mesmerized, reaches towards your beating heart, and then...
hero Everything goes dark, and we die?

n Blade in hand, you run the Princess down.
smitten Wait! No! You *barbarian!* What do you think you're doing?
n But you ignore the pleas of the foolish little voice and press on. The Princess's eyes grow wide with terror as you approach, but she does absolutely nothing to stop you.

n You turn the tip of your blade towards the unsuspecting Princess. Thank you.
smitten Wait... no! You barbarian, what are you doing?
n But you ignore the pleas of the foolish little voice, and strike. The Princess' eyes grow wide with terror as the blade falls, but she does absolutely nothing to stop you.

n Your blade pierces her heart, and she collapses pathetically to the ground.
p I'm sorry... did I do something wrong?
smitten No, my love! You did nothing wrong! I'm sorry! I'M SORRY, NOT YOU!
p I'm going to die now. I think that's what you want.

n And just like that, she's dead. And the world is saved. Thank you for seeing this through. I know it must have been difficult.
hero I feel sick.
smitten Sick?! You took part in the murder of the fairest creature that's ever lived, and you merely feel *sick?!* I for one am absolutely distraught! Grief-stricken. *Inconsolable!*
n You'll get over it. You just saved *everyone.*
smitten "Get over it?" You smarmy ASS. There's nothing in the world worth "getting over it" for! We might as well just end it all!
n You raise the blade, aiming the point directly towards your heart -- *excuse me?!* No, you absolutely do not do that.
hero Yeah, let's not make any rash decisions, we should give ourselves a minute, take a deep breath and --
smitten Rash? The only rash decision we've made was running our *cursed blade* through her heart...! This is *far* from rash. This is *measured.* This is the only thing left for us to do now that she's gone.

smitten All of you may have previously thought that my passions were too great to stifle, but those were merely passions of joy! My passions of sorrow run deeper than the ocean itself, and you'll find that they are *far* more unstiflable! Have at you! Have at you all!
n I don't believe this.
hero What? What don't you believe?
n You plunge the blade into your own heart, and collapse to the floor.
hero You can't be serious! Why are you helping him?
n I'm not. He just... made it happen. I'm sorry.
smitten That's right. You're *all* sorry.
