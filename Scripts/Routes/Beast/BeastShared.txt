hunted If He doesn't remember what happened, then something else must have trapped us here.
n You're not *trapped* here. Nobody's forcing you to do anything, though the only sensible thing for you to do right now is march up to that cabin and slay the Princess.

jumpanchor assume
hero We did our best with the information we were given.
n And yet you still died, didn't you? So, great. Congratulations. You've been given another chance to actually do this right.

jumpanchor assume2
hunted All the more reason to keep our wits about us. Should we even return to the cabin? We could find a safe little hole somewhere instead...
n You have to go to the cabin. If you don't slay the Princess she's going to end the world, which you're always going to be a part of, even if you're cowering in a hole. There's no escaping your responsibility here.

jumpanchor princessSpecial
hunted Special can mean all sorts of things. Don't let it make you careless. We need clear thoughts and pricked ears.

jumpanchor princessCagey
hunted You're afraid, aren't you? Just like us.
n Of course I'm afraid. Fear is an extremely normal thing to feel when the fate of the entire world is at stake.
hunted But that's not the only thing you're afraid of. You're scared of something *worse.*
n Stop projecting your neuroses onto me and just get to the cabin already.

hunted Does a cat lie to a cornered mouse when it plays with its freedom, or is it just acting out its nature?
hero I don't see why that matters. A lie is a lie, and if anything, she's the one who's cornered.
hunted She could have gotten out of there whenever she wanted to. We should trust nothing that she tells us, only what we hear and smell.

// Cabin //

jumpanchor cabinIntro
nowplaying The Beast
n The interior of the cabin is ruinous and dilapidated. It feels like no one has lived here for a long time, wind rushing in through cracks and holes in the wooden walls. The only furniture of note is a termite-eaten table with a pristine blade perched on its edge.
n The blade is your implement. You'll need it if you want to do this right.

jumpanchor cabinDifferent
hero *Very* different.
hunted I wonder why.
n Maybe that's because you haven't actually been here. I hope this means you'll finally drop that ridiculous past-life nonsense. You haven't died, and you certainly haven't been killed by the Princess.
n So focus up. The world is depending on you.

jumpanchor takeBlade
n You take the blade from the table. It would be difficult to slay the Princess and save the world without a weapon.

// Ask about the mirror //

jumpanchor askMirror
n That's because there isn't a mirror. There's the table, the blade sitting on the table, and the door to the basement. There's nothing else in here.

linebreak

jumpanchor stairsStart
n The door to the basement creaks open, revealing what's left of an old, wooden staircase. It's still sturdy enough that you can make your way down in one piece, though you'll have to be mindful of holes.
n The air seeping up from below is oddly warm and wet, as if you're descending into a jungle. If the Princess lives here, slaying her would probably be doing her a favor.
n She growls up the stairs.
p I can smell you.
hero She sounds almost... feral.
hunted Impatient. Or maybe... eager.
n You carefully make your way down the stairs.
linebreak
n The last step gives way to the damp earth floor of a starlit pit. The walls are obscured by an impenetrable darkness, giving the illusion that the room might stretch on forever. You brush against the wide leaves of plants that surround you on all sides, seemingly the only living things that occupy this strange underground wilderness.
hunted The jungle is pressing in on us... hiding her from view. She could be anywhere.
n You see only a flash of the Princess before she scurries away into the underbrush, dragging her heavy chain behind her.
truth You watch a long tail slip out of sight.
n Remember, she's just a Princess.
hero She is certainly not *just* a princess.
n You're not helping.
hunted It doesn't matter what she is. It only matters what she does.
n Her shining eyes appear between the leaves, staring hungrily at you from the darkness.

jumpanchor dodge1
n You lunge to the side, picking a direction on instinct. As you land you're buffeted by a gust of air disturbed by the sudden motion of a massive body -- the Princess.
n In an instant, she's pounced on the spot where you would have been, her chains rattling across the floor behind her.
truth You finally manage to catch a proper glimpse of her. She crouches on all fours, massive, far more animal than human. Her face is feline, and a single horn sprouts from her forehead.
n Before you can blink, she's gone, vanishing once more into the shadows. But you still feel her gaze on you.
p You're faster than you were before. But you're still meek. Reactive. Prey.
n You whirl around to find her, and your gaze meets hers, a pair of shining eyes peering out at you from just beyond the basement stairs.
hero So she's cut off our escape. Shit. What do we do.

jumpanchor whyEat
p I don't question who I am or what I want. I simply *do.* To act is always better than to react. To do is always better than to watch.

jumpanchor attack3
n A tickling sensation rises at the base of your neck.
hunted Flee!
hero We can't keep doing this.

jumpanchor dodge3
n You're a little slower this time, or maybe she's a little faster. You avoid her slavering jaws, but she manages to graze you, her titanic momentum skinning you along your side.
hero It's like being sideswiped by sandpaper, how is she that fast?!
p You're bleeding now.
n You instinctively touch your side, testing her claim. It's wet and stings from the gentle touch of your fingertips.
hunted A costly mistake. We can't make it again.
hero We will make it again unless something changes. We have to break the pattern.
hunted We need more time. She's cutting off our escape.
p Our game is nearing its end.

hunted This isn't going to work. We're in her domain. We just have to stay alive.
hero If we keep dodging her forever, we're going to get tired. We're going to slip up. We have to take a risk.
n As the Princess lunges from the shadows once more, you tighten your grip on the blade and lash out. It strikes, cutting deep, and the Princess loses her focus, crying out in pained surprise as she crashes into you.
n You're sent sprawling, and can already feel the massive bruise blossoming on your ribs as she scrambles back into the darkness.
hero Ha! Look at that! We wounded her.
hunted And she wounded us. Bad trade.
p That hurt. Are you just the cornered animal you seem to be, or could you be a rival?
n She rears back, then leaps at you, more forceful, more ferocious, more serious. The scuffle is brief, and though you inflict a few deep wounds, you find yourself quickly overwhelmed by her savagery.
n You collapse to the floor, and she wastes no time before pouncing on you in a flurry of claws and blood, your nerves barely able to keep up with the onslaught.
n By the end, you're lying in a nest of your own intestines, spine severed, blood rapidly draining out onto the jungle floor.
n The Princess, drenched in both her blood and yours, idly prods your body.
p Oh, that's it, then. Cornered animal it was.

hero Too tired to think. But we have to think.
hunted We have to move.
n It's too late. Before you get the chance to react, it's over. She makes her last foray from the dark corners of the room, unhinging her dripping maw, her eyes fierce and full of hunger.
n You do you best to dive out of the way, and you... partially succeed.
hero ... Partially?
n Yes. The Princess fails to swallow you whole. She only swallows your lower body.
hero That's just as bad! That's worse, even!
hunted It's death, either way. At least this will be a faster end.
n You look down to see that the dirt between you is strewn with your intestines, trailing all the way up and disappearing behind her blood-stained teeth. Your legs are nowhere to be seen. You start to go into shock.

n You are in a dark and caustic place. A thick, fibrous lining constricts around you, its slick surface impossible to grip, your hands scrabbling uselessly at your surroundings as they compress in on you.

n The flesh around you rumbles as the Princess begins to move, her thundering footfalls twisting you helplessly about. Your skin protests as the corrosive liquid sloshes around you, but there will be no respite for you in sight. The burning grows stronger and you can feel layers of you being peeled away.
p But, you -- you don't belong down here. You came from somewhere else. You came from out there. So I consumed your dead heart, and I carried it in my throat, and I draped what was left of you on my back and I threw myself against that door.

p And then it was gone and I was here. A new enclosure. A nicer cage. But still a prison.
