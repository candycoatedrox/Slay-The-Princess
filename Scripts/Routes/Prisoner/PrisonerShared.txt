skeptic Don't forget what He did to us the last time around. I wouldn't trust a word out of his mouth. There's got to be a way out of here, for us *and* for the Princess. We just have to keep trying.
hero I'm inclined to agree. If He doesn't remember what happened last time, maybe it's best to keep it that way.
n You know I can hear you two, right? It's going to be a lot harder than you think to keep secrets from me.

n And as far as trying to *help* her goes, need I remind you how catastrophically dangerous she is to the world at large? I told you about the stakes of this situation less than a minute ago.

label assume
skeptic The absolute irony. But that's one way to put it, I guess.
hero You *really* don't remember what happened last time, do you? You practically forced the Princess to kill us.
n That doesn't sound like the sort of thing I'd do, which is honestly all the more reason for you to not buy into whatever self-delusions the three of you are crafting.
n *Sigh.* But this is a thought experiment, so I suppose I'll continue to give you the benefit of the doubt. If I did 'practically force the Princess to kill you', it was probably for a good reason. Did you try and free her? Did you *say something really mean to me?* Because if I really did what you said I did, you probably deserved it. I'm a professional, after all.
skeptic Sure you are.

label assume2
skeptic What a conveniently ambiguous group of things for her to ruin. For all we know, the Princess left the cabin and never saw another soul.
n Oh how I wish that were the case, but if the Princess weren't a certain, inevitable threat to the world, the four of us wouldn't be here. And yet, here we are.
skeptic You're talking in circles.
n No, I'm talking in *facts.*

label princessHowDanger
skeptic She just can. Believe me, I wish I could tell you more, but you'll just have to trust that what I'm saying is true and that, despite it all, you're fully up to the task that's been given to you.
n What proof could you possibly ask for?
hero Literally anything.
n *Sigh.* Fine. Check your pockets.

label princessCheckPockets
n You put your hands in your pockets and pull out an envelope with the words "THE EVIDENCE" written across the front.
n Within, you find a note in your handwriting. It reads: "The Princess will end the world if you don't stop her. This is an immutable truth."
skeptic That doesn't prove anything! How do we know you didn't just forge our handwriting?
n I wish I could tell you more, but there are some rules I have to follow for all of our sakes. Please just trust that these rules are in place for a reason. I'm on your side.
skeptic You mean you're on our side as long as we do what you tell us to.
n Exactly. Because you *not* doing what I tell you to do means you're putting the world at risk.
hero I think we've got everything out of him that we're going to get.

// Cabin //

label cabinIntro
nowplaying The Prisoner
n The interior of the cabin is less a cozy woodland retreat and more like a dungeon. A few pathetic wisps of starlight attempt to illuminate the cold, uninviting stone walls, and thick wrought-iron bars barricade the windows, reminding anyone who enters that this is a prison.
n The only furniture of note is an iron table, bolted to the floor, a pristine blade perched on its edge.
n The blade is your implement. You'll need it if you want to do this right.

label cabinDifferent
hero *Very* different.
skeptic Yes, but *why?* Did He change it, or did it change all on its own? Maybe it's a different cabin entirely.
n Now isn't that a novel thought! Maybe you *haven't* actually been here before. I hope this means you'll finally drop that ridiculous past-life nonsense. You haven't died, and you certainly haven't been killed by the Princess.
n So focus up. Don't get distracted by minor details.

label takeBlade
n You take the blade from the table. It would be difficult to slay the Princess and save the world without a weapon.
skeptic Good idea. Much better to be armed than to go in with blind hope alone.

// Ask about the mirror //

label askMirror
skeptic He definitely did not. Does a mirror not count as "furniture of note" to you? Because it should.
n There isn't a mirror. There's a table, the blade sitting on the table, and the door to the basement. There's nothing else in here.

label askMirrorStart
skeptic I think you know what we have to do.

label mirrorHandsome
skeptic Let's not get caught up in vanity, but we should definitely take a closer look. Whatever it is, He must not want us to know about it.
n Is this some sort of rehearsed bit? Use your eyes, there is no mirror. Why would I lie about something so meaningless? What good would it even do?

label mirrorNoMatterIntro
skeptic We should treat everything in here like it matters.
hero Exactly, don't you care if we're being lied to? If He's willing to lie about something as innocuous as a mirror, what else is He hiding from us?

skeptic And now it's gone. If He doesn't want us to know about it, it must be important. We should keep our eyes peeled. Maybe it'll be back.

skeptic Yes. I'm sure. And I've already got a plan for that.

n *Sigh.* As much as I'd like to remain in denial, it's no use. This has complicated things.

n Ideally this was supposed to be one-and-done. You go to the cabin, you heroically slay the Princess, and in the process, you save the entire world from being damned to oblivion.
n This situation right now, where you're getting a second shot at things, is a contingency.

n Exactly. He gets it. You're lucky. So don't waste that luck by messing it up again, all right?
skeptic Moving on. Why is it important for us to be ignorant? How is it ever helpful to be in the dark?
n The more I say, the more your mind will swim into dangerous waters. Even saying that is too much.
n Your success hinges on you having imperfect information. For the sake of the entire world, you need to accept that.

hero That doesn't sound great. What about the pros?

n And especially when your promised reward is not, in fact, empty, and is worth all the adversity you've been through to get here.

// Give the Princess the blade //

label giveBladeStart
p Slide it over.
n No. Absolutely not. I am not letting you hand your only weapon over to the *world-ending* Princess. Until you come up with any other idea -- like, say, I don't know, doing your job and slaying her -- you remain rigidly in place.
    jumpto giveBladeProof /// check
skeptic Do you think this will work? Interesting that you're only having us remain in place. It's almost like there are very real limits to your power.
n I don't know what you're talking about.
skeptic The world ends if we fail, right? Her killing us might not be our only failure state, if you catch my meaning.
hero I don't know where you're going with this. Could you explain?
n Yes. Explain it.
skeptic Sure. I'm insinuating that we could kill ourself. Ruin this whole thing.
n You wouldn't.
skeptic I'm not afraid of dying. Are you?
hero A little...
n You got your point across. Fine.

skeptic You tried this last time. Do you want to know how it went for you?
hero Oh, I remember! She killed us, which by your estimation, ended the world. Right?
n *Angry grumbling.*
skeptic Exactly. If I were you, I wouldn't be too keen on repeating your mistake. Hell, we could even force your hand and do it ourselves. I'm not afraid of dying again. Are you?
hero A little...
n I think you got your point across. Fine.
label giveBladeJoin
n *Sigh.* You slide the blade across the floor.
n The Princess maintains unsettling eye contact as she reaches down to pick it up.
p Thanks.
n She pulls up her hair, smiling slightly as she raises the blade to her throat.

// The Princess decapitates herself //

label headStart
hero What is she *doing?*
n She doesn't say another word as she cuts into her own neck.
hero No...!

label awayHead
n You close your eyes, but that doesn't stop you from hearing every grisly detail. The splitting of skin, the wet mulching of severed veins, the grinding of metal against bone.
n I'll be damned. She's actually doing your job for you. Why would she do that?
skeptic Huh. So that's her play.
hero Killing herself?!
skeptic We don't know that she's dead yet. We're not even watching it happen. She could just be faking those sounds.
n And then finally you hear a snap, and an uneasy silence.
n There is a slow and fleshy tear. Hard to fake that.
hero This is worse than watching.
skeptic And yet our eyes are still closed.
n Finally, there's the soft thud of something roughly head-sized bouncing against the floor, and the clattering of chains as they drop along with it.
n I think you can open your eyes now.

label watchHead
n Her eyes stare forward, unblinking, as she saws through skin, veins, cartilage. At last she reaches bone, the blade grinding audibly against her vertebrae as it continues to slice its way through her neck.
n I'll be damned. She's actually doing your job for you. Why would she do that?
skeptic Huh. So that's her play.
hero Killing herself?!
skeptic She isn't dead yet.
n Finally, you hear a snap. Her eye twitches.
n There's an uneasy silence. She remains motionless for a long moment, her twitching eye the only movement in the room, until at last it stops in an unsettling half-wink.
n Her head twists slowly to the side, flopping to her shoulder, and her neck... opens.
n The remaining tissue is not enough to hold the weight of her severed head. It stretches and tears, until finally, it falls to the floor, completely free. It bounces a few times before rolling to a stop at your feet.
label headJoin
hero Oh no oh no o-oh no what did we do? C-can we put it back? *Please* tell me we can put it back.
n The Princess' eyes stare up at you. Dead. Congratulations. You saved the world.
skeptic Huh. So I guess that's it. What a way to go. But she is gone, isn't she?
hero I. Hate. This. Can we just -- get out of here now. *Please.*
n Of course. The Princess is slain, and the world is saved. Whenever you're ready you can proceed to your reward.
skeptic Now hold on. She's dead. So what's the rush? What's your angle?
n I don't have an angle. I'm just looking forward to putting all this behind us, I'm sure you can understand that.
skeptic Look, I'm just not ready to put my guard down. It's best to keep sharp. She wouldn't have done all that without some kind of reason, she's left us with this dangling thread and I need to know *why.*
n You're just wasting your energy. The danger has passed, and now we can all relax and enjoy your reward!

// "Talking Heads" ending; claim the Prisoner's head //
n Ugh. Fine. You pick up the Princess' severed head, its neck stump still oozing bodily fluids, then make your way back upstairs to the first floor of the cabin.
skeptic Did you see that? I could have sworn she moved.
n She didn't. She's dead.
hero But... what if she's not?
n Are you listening to yourself? Do I need to explain to you why decapitation is lethal? The door to your bountiful reward is right in front of you -- all you have to do is open it.

n You open the cabin door, ready to return to a world saved from certain doom.
n Only, a world saved from certain doom isn't what you find. Instead, what you find is -- wait, no, that's not right.
truth The Princess slowly opens her eyes.
p Well played.
quietcreep
n This is -- this -- this is the end of the world, isn't it? I always thought I'd at least have time to explain myself before I had to watch it happen, but it's already --
hero ... Over? Is He gone?
skeptic But we're still here. Maybe it wasn't the end of the world after all. Maybe it was just the end of His.
p Thanks for carrying me up here. I had to take it on faith that you would know what to do. I'm glad I was right to trust you.
p So this is the outside. Maybe it's just my lack of body, but... it's colder than I expected.

skeptic ... Fine. But if we're leaving, then we're taking the blade. I feel... exposed without it.
linebreak
n With your work done, you remove the blade from the Princess' corpse and make your way back upstairs, closing the door to the basement behind you. You can think of it as sealing yourself off from an unpleasant chapter of your life. It's all uphill from here!
skeptic The windows. Do you see that? We used to be able to see the outside world from up here, but now it's just... empty.
skeptic The door! Check the door!

n You open the cabin door, ready to return to a world saved from certain doom.
n Only, a world saved from certain doom isn't what you find. Instead, what you find is nothing at all. Where a lush forest stood mere minutes ago, the only thing in front of you now is the vast emptiness of some place far away.
skeptic You don't have to act surprised. We could see this "vast emptiness" through the windows.
hero But if everything's gone... Does that mean we're not gonna get our reward?
n This *is* your reward. An eternity of bliss, if you'll have it. And I suggest that you have it.
hero O... kay...
n This is what's best for everyone. Trust me.
skeptic Like hell it is!

n Time passes. You can't be sure if it's days, or months, or years, or even decades. It's all a wonderful, boring blur. You've never been happier.

n He's suggesting you kill yourself. You shouldn't kill yourself when you have an eternity of bliss right in front of you.

label slainAccept
n That's great! Congratulations. You've earned it.
n More happy time passes, though the word begins to lose its meaning. "Time," that is, not "happy." "Happy" still has plenty of meaning.
skeptic He's just saying things.
n The voice's protestations fall on deaf ears.
n Eventually, you pass into a blissful state of pure existence. Though words like "eventually" and "pass" ceased to have any meaning to you long before that shift. You simply exist. Happy. Forever.
