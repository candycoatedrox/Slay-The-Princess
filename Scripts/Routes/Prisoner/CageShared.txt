truth You're falling, the world is spinning. And then you hit the ground, your body light in a way that is sickeningly wrong, and roll to a stop. The sound of rattling chains and a heavy thud as the rest of what was once you falls to the ground somewhere nearby.
truth You are unable to take action, unable to defend yourself, unable to even look around as the Princess's body steps towards you, one slow, rhythmic step after another.
truth It stoops down to pick you up and then --
truth A shadow rises behind the body, blade glinting.
p And now`, the cut.

truth It strikes, and it strikes true, and the body drops its cage in pain.
truth They descend on each other in a maelstrom of chains and hooks and feathers and blood, fighting their way deeper into the shadows until all you're left to witness are the sounds of violence.

p It's all going to come to a head soon.

n Suddenly, the chains loosen, the hooks sliding from your skin. You come crashing to the floor. And as the chains rain down around you, her body falls, too.

n But even if I'm doomed to go, I might as well make sure you have a *proper ending.* Go on, then.

n You cautiously approach the kneeling body, and extend your hand, bruised and bleeding from the trials that brought you to this point.
n And then you take her from her prison. She looks up at you, and for the first time since you laid eyes on her, she smiles. Warmly.
p I have... no idea how we're supposed to leave.
n But the body points, and you follow its finger to a lone chain dangling from the doorway that sits far, far above you.

p I'm sorry... if I made this harder than it had to be.
n You glance back towards the Princess's body, doing its part as it hoists you up. It grows smaller, and smaller, slowly disappearing back into the shadows of the basement.
p No, that's -- not right`. There shouldn't be an if`. I'm sorry`. I made this harder than it had to be.
skeptic Maybe she has a point, in a way. Our bodies don't matter.

hero Y-yeah, what he said. It slices through!
skeptic Now hold on. Let's not rush to conclusions. How would that *ever* work?
para It just... does?
n It doesn't.
para Maybe the only reason it isn't working is because SOMEONE doesn't believe we can do it!
skeptic They're metal chains, and nothing we've done has worked so far. Maybe if you gave me a *good reason* to believe we should try again, I'd believe it was worth trying again. But until then, I'm going to believe our *eyes.* This isn't getting us anywhere.
para Erm... you should believe it because you... sh-should! We don't have anything better to do!
hero Um, um... maybe they're... rusty! He... did say they were rusty, didn't He?
skeptic He did, didn't He? All right, I'm game. We cut again.
n You bring your blade against the chains again, and this time you manage to cut into the metal. Its hook remains embedded in your flesh, but your arm falls from the mass of chains, free from the Princess's bindings.
hero *Yes!* Will you look at that.
skeptic That... worked?
para And why shouldn't the rest be the same, then?

para Yes! The links are weak. They can't handle the strain! I-isn't that right?
n You know, it's rather annoying for you to dictate what I'm going to say next.
skeptic But *is* that what happens? Do the links break?
n Yes. Luckily for you, they were too thoroughly rusted to hold much longer. Your other arm breaks free.

hero Yeah? What of it?
skeptic This whole thing's been a RIDDLE! Blade! Heart! NOW!

n Blade flashing, you rush towards the Princess.
n Her body continues its slow march towards you, never changing course even as you sink your weapon into its heart.
n Its... hand wraps around yours, its flesh cold and its grip firm. But it does not try to wrench itself free. It instead... drives the blade *deeper* into its own chest.
p I cut myself free.
n The body collapses to its knees. And as it crumples, life seeming to leave it at last, the door of the cage creaks open. The head of the Princess tumbles out.
n Congratulations! It would seem that you *actually* managed to see this through. All that's left is to watch her perish...
