n The interior of the cabin is a mess of twisted roots, the walls a chaotic weave of knotted wood that, almost as if by accident just happened to resemble a room. The floor is damp and earthy, and the only furniture of note is a slab of mud in the shape of a shelf, with a pristine blade perched on its edge.
n The blade is your implement. You'll need it if you want to do this right.

n You take the blade from the shelf. It would be difficult to slay the Princess and save the world without a weapon.

hero That's not... actually a bad idea.

hero Oh no?
oppo It's the blade, isn't it? I was going to tell you to grab it once we got upstairs. That was the whole "keep your eyes peeled" thing. And then you would have stabbed her in the back, and we would've been winners!

n As the roots that make up the walls of the cramped basement attempt to close in around you, instinct kicks in, and you bolt upstairs.
n The steps are uneven and lively, creaking as they expand out of the dirt floor, the stairway growing smaller and smaller as you dart up towards the light. You manage to squeeze through the door just as the entrance seals itself shut behind you.
n The cabin is smaller than it was before. And it's getting even smaller, and smaller.
oppo That's fine. We'll just leave!
n I'm sure you'd like to do that. But unfortunately, there is no longer a front door. The roots have already closed over the only possible exit. What little light peaks through the holes that were once windows is growing weaker as the cabin continues to close in on itself.
hero Shit. What do we do?!
n As your mind races for an answer, you hear the Princess' voice crackle up the stairs.

n No arguments here. You're doing great, keep playing dirty if that's what it takes.

oppo That's nice and all, but *are we winning?*
n Nobody's winning. I thought playing dirty was supposed to give you the upper hand, but I suppose that doesn't work if you both sink to the same lows... still, at least you're not losing.

hero Wait... what's going on?
oppo We're establishing a newer, better pecking order.
hero No, the groaning thing. Why is the wood making noise?
oppo Who cares about the groan? It's just a sound. Things make sounds all the time.
hero I care about the groan! Doesn't that mean something bad is happening?
n Oh yes, well, I'm afraid that's the sound of the basement getting smaller.

n You and the Princess disengage for a brief moment, just long enough to get your bearings. Behind you, the basement door has been sealed over, thick roots barring your only exit from the dirt pit. And slowly, but very perceptibly, the roots are closing in on you both.
