cheated She stabbed us! She actually stabbed us!
oppo Of course she stabbed us. We gave her the blade. Which, might I add, I voted against.
cheated But the whole point was that she wasn't supposed to do that. The whole point of giving her the blade was to break the cycle of violence. And she just... she just killed us anyway!
hero I guess it really doesn't matter that she killed us though, right? We're back here, which means that everything's fine. Or fine-adjacent.
hero Maybe she won't be as keen to betray us *this* time. We've already proven to her that we can change. Maybe that's all it'll take to show her there's another way to do things.

hero I can't believe she actually stabbed us!
oppo I told you not to give her the blade. I told you it would come around to bite us. I voted against it.
hero Yeah, we know. You already got your "I-told-you-sos" in while we were bleeding out.
oppo I just wanted to make sure that everyone here knows that I was and am on the right side of that argument.
smitten Oh, you're far from being on the right side of anything. You're fixated on the past, whereas what you should be is fixated on *the future!*
oppo Oho! A *visionary.* I like it, tell me more.
smitten Gladly, my dear fellow. By cruelly turning on the Princess in her moment of vulnerability, we made ourselves an enemy. But, by mastering our fear and insecurity and handing over our power, we've begun a journey to something *so* much deeper.
oppo I like journeys. Traveling is a bit of a passion of mine. It makes me so *relatable.* Now where are we off to?
smitten Well, if we're lucky, it's a journey... to *love.*
hero She hates us.
smitten Does she? She hesitated before stabbing us to death.
hero Maybe she won't be as keen to betray us *this* time. We've already proven to her that we can change. So maybe she'll realize that things don't have to end in violence.

oppo You know, maybe you're right! In which case, I suppose the only thing to do is to get back to the cabin and give it another try.

        n Oh, are you now? /// checkvoice-smitten

hero Twice, actually.
n Sure. Twice. *Sigh.* Then I'll spare you the little introduction I had planned. You already know about the Princess, and clearly, you already know that she's dangerous. So don't muck this up. It's bad enough that this isn't your first time through.

label differentWoods
n Wonderful. If the woods themselves are changing, then that's all the more reason for you to take this seriously. It would mean your grip on things is slipping, which in turn, likely means her influence is spreading.
oppo Someone's in the know.
    cheated I've had enough of these annoying little secrets. If you want us to do this, you have to let us in on your game already! All of your game. /// checkvoice
n *Sigh.* I've already said too much. The more information you have, the more difficult your task will be. Don't listen to her, definitely don't free her, and if you can, don't even think about her.

oppo Yes, good. Playing both sides. That's what smart people do, and you're the smartest in the room.
hero I'm not sure it counts as "playing both sides" if people can hear you doing it.
oppo Buddy, you're thinking in far too few dimensions. There's layers to doing this right, and I'm pretty sure the one making the choices gets that. Trust in the plan!
hero Trust in what plan?
oppo The decider's plan! Sure, we don't know what the plan is yet, but that's part of the whole "trusting" thing, isn't it? A good leader knows how and when to keep things secret. And sometimes a good leader even knows to keeps things secret from himself.
    smitten There isn't a plan and that's the whole point! We're supposed to be guided by emotion. We're supposed to passionately live in the moment. And I'm sure that when the time comes, those passions will tell us to set our darling Princess free. /// checkvoice
    cheated Sure. We'll see what she has to say for herself. But don't forget that whatever she says is likely just as much lies as what He's been telling us. We should keep our cards close to our chest. /// checkvoice

n That's the spirit. Don't forget what she's done to you. She's practically asking for you to slay her.
    smitten Even though we were stabbed in the heart, it doesn't mean that we don't still have one. She'll come around, just like we did. /// checkvoice
    cheated You're damned right! You need two to break a cycle of violence, and if she's not playing the same game as us, we've got to go back to treating her like an enemy. /// checkvoice

hero Because that's worked out great so far.
oppo Well, we're not out of the game yet, are we? And again, I'll have you know I wouldn't have gotten us killed last time. I wanted to stab her in the back, not hand over our precious back-stabbing implement!

n She gets out, is what happens. Maybe not right away, but eventually. And a world that's doomed tomorrow is just as bad as a world that's doomed today.

hero So you knew this could happen?
n Theoretically, sure. I knew this *could* happen. But I was supposed to be the first. I'd really rather not get into it.
    smitten I don't care about where we came from and I don't care to discuss the theory of anything. I yearn only to bring her freedom. I'm here to feel, not to think! /// checkvoice

n Then we can all move on! And forget what I said about failure.
n It's important that you believe in yourself, and the fact that you're here probably means that you still have a chance to pull this off and save the world. My world, at least. It sounds like you've probably doomed a couple of others already.

n The only furniture of note is the crisped shell of what was once a table, a pristine -- wait, this isn't right. There's supposed to be a pristine blade. Why isn't there a pristine blade?
hero We... we gave it to her last time. She can't still have it, can she?
oppo Well, it's not here. And if she has it...
hero Let me guess, you want to get all chummy with her.
oppo Look, as far as I see it, if it's between Him and her, I say we side with the one who has the weapon. It's just the smart thing to do!
n I wouldn't be so hasty. I'm sure the blade will turn up somewhere. She can't have it, that's not how this is supposed to work.
    cheated Of course we don't get to make a choice about the blade. Every single time we come back here, something has to be different. /// checkvoice

n The stairs to the basement are covered in a fine layer of gritty ash. The air still feels warm, as if the fires that ruined this place had only recently been extinguished, yet fresh shoots of thorny branches are already weaving themselves through the soot-covered earth of the walls around you.
n Their spines point courteously down towards the basement, so you're able to brush past their jagged points with ease. At least on the way down. But you don't need to think about the way back up just yet. That's a matter for after the world's been saved.
    smitten These thorns are an expression of her pain, I know it. She's calling out for help! /// checkvoice

p Did you know this was going to happen to me? Are you here to watch me suffer? Are you here to laugh?

p Do you really think you can just wash your hands of all this? Do you really think you can just leave me here?!
oppo This is even better than stabbing her. The same reward without any of that nasty effort.
n It's not "even better." Putting off a choice is always worse than making a committed decision, especially when you already know the right answer.
    smitten It's even more cruel if you ask me. Leaving an incredible soul like hers to languish forever, in pain and alone. How can we bear to live with the guilt? /// checkvoice

n But as you approach the basement stairs, you make a grim realization. The thorns won't let you leave.
hero And we don't have any way to cut through them.
oppo Okay! New plan. We re-befriend the Princess, get the blade, and all of us leave here together as friends.
p You can't leave without me, can you? Isn't that funny. Isn't that so funny! This is perfect, actually. Just you and me, rotting down here forever. Together.
    smitten It's what we deserve after everything we've done. It's... romantic, even. We got our beautiful ending after all, tragic as it may be. /// checkvoice
p You know, just to make sure things are little more permanent, I think I'm going to take this particular needle out of the picture.
oppo She wouldn't.
    cheated It's only fair. We were going to leave her with no way out. She's returning the kindness. /// checkvoice
n Thorns slice into the Princess' hands, lacerating what little skin remains, as she raises the blade to her mouth.

quietcreep
n You rush towards the Princess, arm outsretched and grasping for the blade.
n But as you tear through her thistled prison, the thorny vines dig deep into your arms, seemingly growing thicker and sturdier the closer you get to your goal. It feels like it should be within reach, yet you cannot reach it quickly enough.
hero It's no use. Even if we grab it, we won't be able to pull it back out of there.
oppo It's better than letting her eat it and losing it forever!
unlock thornTrust
n You just manage to reach her hand, grasping it firmly in yours, before the thorns finally trap you in place. Blood trickles down your arm, mingling with hers. The two of you lock eyes.
p We're stuck like this, aren't we? I knew this was always going to be how it ended.
