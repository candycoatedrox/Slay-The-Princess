n *Sigh.* Okay. Let's *try* to get back on track. You're real. The Princess is real. The world is real. The *people* in the world are real. And the *danger* she poses to all of them is also, quite unfortunately, real.

p YOU WOULDN'T DARE! MOVE! NOW!
n Your body, still slumped against the wall, trapped between the Princess' overwhelming will and the blinding pain of your splintered ankle, takes an excruciating step towards the cabin door. The movement is stiff, your body reduced to a marionette, pulled reluctantly along by your strings.
p IT'S NOT THAT BAD. THE PAIN FEELS GOOD. BECAUSE I KNOW YOU FEEL IT TOO.

p I WON'T LET YOU DO THIS!
n Capillaries burst and muscle fibers tear as you and the Princess struggle over the reins of your body, one foot planted firmly on the edge where the floor ends and the nothing begins. It's unquestionable that her reserves are greater than yours, but fortunately for you, the distance you have to cover is far shorter.
