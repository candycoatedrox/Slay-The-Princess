n This is bad.
hero Oh, is it now? I hadn't noticed! Do you need a primer, Mr. Amnesiac?
n No, I'm quite alright, but if all of you would take a moment to settle down, there's something important I'd like to get across to you before it's too late.
hero Is it about the Princess? We already know all about the Princess.
n No! I mean yes. It's about the Princess, but whatever you think I'm going to say, it's probably not that.
hero Look, fine. Just out with it already, yeah? But if I hear the words "you're here to slay her" or "if you don't, it will be the end of the world" you'll have lost speaking privileges.
broken You two are just wasting your time. It's all going to end when we open that cabin door, which means it's already all over. What's the point of dawdling when the end is already written?
n Okay, that nonsense he's going on about? That's what we need to talk about. You've been here before. Obviously.
n Whatever you did before gave her far too much power. So you've got to cut it out, get to that cabin, and slay her before things get any more out of hand.
para Are... are our *thoughts* doing that? Make her small, make her small, make her small, make her small... Sh-shit! What if I'm doing it wrong? Wh-what if I'm making her even stronger?!
broken We've built a new god, and she is limitless.
n Do you hear those two with their runaway thoughts? I'm only giving you the sliver of information I'm giving you now, because things are already deep in the shitter. This was my last card to play, and it looks like it's already made things worse. So hurry. Cabin. Now.

hero I think this is three.
contra Who cares?! The woods are always the worst part, anyway. Nothing ever happens in them!

contra Feels like the numbers getting thrown around here are too big not to be... abstract.
hero Numbers like... five?
contra Numbers like entire realities. At the end of the day it's all just silly, isn't it? None of us can count to a whole reality, and he's asking us to think about the difference between three and five.
n *Sigh.* You're already starting to lose the thread. Just because you can't personally sum up the contents of an entire reality doesn't mean that the people inhabiting it don't contain moral value. If you have any sense of ethics left in there, if you have any moral compass... please. You have to stop her.

contra So what! Just because she made us kill ourselves, we're supposed to submit to her authority without question?

broken You all talk about *choices* and *freedom,* but there is no choice when it comes to the will of a god.

Hell, whether *I* like it or not, you're a part of us. *That* was your moment, too, and we can have another if we all work together. She's not your "perfect goddess."

broken But... I *love* her.

truth You look down. At the Princess's feet writhes a shifting mound, a mass of hands clambering over each other, crawling their way up her body. They start to pull.
p NO!
truth The mound becomes a sea, and the Princess struggles to stay afloat, to keep the two of you close to the hole in the world and the light of the something beautiful beyond. But she is drowning.
truth As the sea rises, she pulls you from her shoulder and holds you above the tide. You turn back to look at her.
broken We have to be able to do something to *help* her! This can't be how it ends, it *can't!* It can't it can't it *can't!*
p I think... this is the end. I can feel every part of me freezing over.
truth Hands reach over hands, pulling at her face. Dragging her down into their frigid depths. She is tired, and life fades from her eyes.
p You have been the only thing I've ever known to show me grace. I am sorry if I have not shown you the same.

truth The Princess summons the last of her strength, her face a shield of purpose and determination. In her final act, she hurls you towards the hole in the world, towards the something beautiful beyond.
p Fly, little bird.
broken No, *no!* I don't *want* to be somewhere she isn't! It would always be dark without her...!
hero It's what she wants for us. But... can we make it?
    contra Of course we can, we can do whatever we want. And I... believe in her. /// checkvoice
    para Yeah. We just have to believe, and everything is going to be okay. /// checkvoice
truth But the hole seals before you can make it to the other side. If there is a time to bask in what lies beyond, it is not now.
