hero If He doesn't remember what happened, then maybe it's best to keep it that way.
n You know I can hear you, right? It's going to be a lot harder than you think to keep secrets from me.
stubborn That's fine. It doesn't matter if He can hear us. The only thing that matters is marching up to that cabin and *winning.*
n That's the spirit. There's no point in squabbling when the real threat is just up that hill.

hero We did our best with the information we were given. And we *did* kill her.
n And yet you still died, didn't you? So congratulations. You've been given another chance to actually do this right.

n I couldn't agree more. The cabin, and your destined confrontation with the Princess, awaits.

label princessImpatient

n There's nothing wrong with getting the full picture of what's going on here.
stubborn Sure there is. It's wasting time and energy that would be better spent fighting.

label princessSpecial
n Look, I'm not supposed to say this, but it's because you're special. You're the *only* person capable of doing this. Call it a prophecy if that helps, but it's just the way things are.
hero Oh. I didn't know we were *special.*
stubborn Of course we're special.

label princessCagey
stubborn What else would we even *need* to know? We've got all the reason we need for a rematch.
n Exactly. The less you know about her, the better.

// Hill dialogue //

label hillDialogue
stubborn "Lying" and "cheating" doesn't sound like her at all. Not that it matters, it's not like she can lie or cheat in the middle of a fight.
hero Are you sure about that?
n The point of my warning wasn't to start an argument over what circumstances the Princess is capable of lying in. It was to give you some broadly applicable advice.
n The Princess will do and say whatever she thinks it will take to get her out of there. So don't trust her. Ever. Are we clear?
stubborn Crystal. Let's just get on with it already.

label cabinIntro

n The cabin is tighter than its exterior would suggest. Its cold stone walls press in on you, as if trying to forcefully direct you towards your destination. The only furniture of note is a black-iron altar with a pristine blade perched on its edge.
n The blade is your implement. You'll need it if you want to do this right.

label takeBlade
n You take the blade from the altar. It would be difficult to slay the Princess and save the world without a weapon.

// Ask about the mirror //

label askMirror
n That's because there isn't a mirror. There's the altar, the blade sitting on the altar, and the door to the basement. There's nothing else in here.

label mirrorGone

// Stairs //

label stairsNoBlade
stubborn No blade this time? Right then, fisticuffs it is. Probably more fair to her anyway. Wouldn't want to feel like we cheated our way to a win.

n The door to the basement creaks open, revealing a rough stone staircase, its walls pressing at your sides and tightening as you descend. The air seeping from below is heavy and oppressive, with an almost sulfuric odor to it. If the Princess lives here, slaying her would probably be doing her a favor.
n Her fierce voice carries up the stairs.
p Is that another challenger? *Finally.* It's been ages since I've had a good fight.
hero This isn't what she sounded like last time. Her voice is a little deeper, almost threatening.
stubborn Good. Sounds like my kind of Princess.
n As much as I appreciate the enthusiasm, just make sure you don't let your bloodlust get to your head. You need to stay focused and keep your wits about you. Remember you're here to *slay* the Princess, not to have a good fight.
linebreak
n As you descend the final step, the form of the Princess comes into view, a large shackle leading from her wrist to the basement wall.
truth This time, she looks almost demonic. She stands tall on hooved feet, her dress torn and tattered. Horns sprout from her forehead in place of her tiara. Her pointed tail flicks back and forth behind her as she catches sight of you, a cruel grin splitting her face.
hero It looks like she could rip those chains out of the wall without a second thought.
p Oh, it's you again. I've been hoping you'd find your way back here. Good to see that death doesn't stick for either of us.

hero I. I don't like that resignation. Are you sure we can't just unthink it?
n Yes. Like I said, I'm afraid some thoughts can't be unthought. I'll be back in a moment. I'm going to pour myself a stiff drink. If I'm going to see the end of everything, I'd rather not be sober.
stubborn So I was right! Why are all of you so glum? This is perfect, isn't it? We get to experience greatness and battle and triumph forever.
n Well, I think it was the stubborn one who said your destiny awaits, right?
hero No no no. No. Hold on, there has to be another way. What if we just leave her down here? What if we run away? What if we convince her to *not* end the world?
n You can't reason with her. Ending the world is her fundamental nature. It's not a decision she can flip on and off. It *is* her.
hero And why exactly can't we leave her down here?
n Because all it would do is stall the inevitable.
hero And what's wrong with stalling?
n Oh there's plenty wrong with stalling. The end is still the end, and I'd rather face mine head-on.
hero Oh, you mopey ass. Why did you even ask us to slay her if it was going to end like this?
n Because it didn't have to end like this. If you don't mind, I'd rather not spend everyone's last moments arguing with you.
stubborn It's time.
n Yes. I suppose it is.
hero If... if we fight her forever, then maybe she can't end the world. Maybe everything can still work out.
n I guess we'll just have to see how things play out.

n Until you come up with *any other idea,* your body remains standing rigidly in place.
stubborn What do you think you're doing?! You can't just order our body around like it's some sort of... doll!
n Watch me! Your left arm lifts towards the ceiling, and your hand twists into an obscene gesture! See? I can make you do whatever I want.
stubborn So what, you barely managed to lift our arm.
p What are you doing? What is that? Why are you moving so... weird?
n The Princess, taken aback, flashes her own rude gesture in return.
stubborn Hey. You. Decision-maker. I want us to fight her as much as he wants us to kill her, but this is... boorish. Just ignore him. If you want to try and free her, *I* don't think there's much he can do to actually *stop* you.

n You know what? Fine. Blade in hand, you charge forward to try and free the Princess from her bindings.
p Finally! I have no idea what you were just doing, but I'm glad it's over.
n As you slash across her wrist, her elbow comes crashing down on your skull. An unsettling crack echoes in your ears.
n It's a devastating blow. Your body crumples to the floor, limbs suddenly refusing to respond. This... might be it.
p That's it, huh? You've gotten really soft.

n Everything goes dark, and you die.
hero Really? In just one blow?
n Yes.
stubborn Oh, come on, that's hardly fair! We're not dead, you're just -- you're just flipping the table over!
n It is what it is. You're dead. Finished. Over.
stubborn *Grumbling.* All right. Fine, this whole thing's a frustrating mess anyways. We're better off with a fresh start. I'll see you two next time.
