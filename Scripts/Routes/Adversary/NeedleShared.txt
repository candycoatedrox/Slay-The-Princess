skeptic Mhm. So where does that leave us?
n It leaves us exactly where we started, and where I'm sure you've already been before. The Princess, left unhindered, will bring about the end of world. You have to put a stop to her, and the only way to do that is to slay her.
stubborn Screw it! I'm sick of this SMUG ASSHOLE telling us what to do. If you need help busting her out of there, I'm your man.
