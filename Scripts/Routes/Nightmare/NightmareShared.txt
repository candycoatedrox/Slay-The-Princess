p Come along, now. You don't want to be stuck down here.
n The Princess glides onto the stairs and beckons you to follow. If only you had a weapon. This would be the perfect opportunity to use it.
hero But we don't. And we've already made our choice.
linebreak
para We can still grab it on the way out.
hero You're not wrong, but maybe you should let me handle the suggestions for the time being. Just focus on keeping us alive.
para Hahaha. Right...
para Heart. Lungs. Liver. Nerves. Heart...

n You step onto the basement stairs, following the Princess as she ascends. Pins and needles punctuate your every step, an uncomfortable and constant reminder of your mortality.
n Is this really worth it?
hero At least it's a choice.
n That doesn't justify anything. A terrible choice is still terrible.
p Make sure you keep up. We wouldn't want you to fall.
n As if acting on instinct, you crane your neck and look behind you. There is nothing there.
n The Princess reaches the top of the stairs and taps the door.
n Her head twists back in your direction, watching you with dead eyes as the way out creaks open.
n Don't forget that your pristine blade is still on the other side. You can still make this right. You can still save everyone, and you can still save yourself from becoming her tormented pet.
linebreak
para There's no harm in us having a weapon. All it does is give us more options. And we are dangerously low on those right now.
hero Um...
para Have you considered that maybe *you* could operate the autonomic nervous system for a bit? Everyone is trying to manipulate us and I can only do *so many things at once* to keep us alive.
hero Er... heart? Erm. Liver...?
n Your body seizes violently as you regain consciousness on the floor of the cabin.
para No, no, *no!* You're doing it all wrong! You're supposed to do it like this: Heart. Lungs. Liver. Nerves. Heart...
para I guess I have to do *everything* around here, don't I?
para Heart. Lungs. Liver. Nerves. Heart...
linebreak
p There we go, back with me where you belong! I thought you might have decided to break yourself just to spite me. It's better for you that you didn't.
p Now we can get back to business. For starters, we won't need this where we're going!
n The Princess plucks the blade from the floor and tosses it through the door behind you. It vanishes into the inky black of the basement, never to be seen again.
hero I guess we're not stabbing her in the back.
n *Sigh.* I guess not.
n I'm going to fix myself a stiff drink. If I'm about to watch you hand the world to her on a silver platter, I'd rather not be sober.
p And now you open the door.
hero There's nothing else for us to do.

n The doorknob twists in your hand, revealing the forested path beyond the cabin. You bastard. You've actually done it. You've actually doomed everyone.

p It's so beautiful. I can't wait to ruin it.
p But it's so cold, too. It's... itching against my skin.
truth The Princess, exhausted, slumps to the ground.
p Why is it so cold?

truth Something reaches out and folds her into its myriad arms.

n Your will concentrates into a single fine point, and you strike out against the Princess, ignoring the constant reminders of your breaking body.
n She doesn't even move as the blade sinks into her heart.
hero We did it. We actually did it!
p Hahahaha! You actually went for it! Oh you're going to regret this! I can be so much more terrible for you than I am now!
hero C-can she?
para We've already seen how she can change... heart. Lungs. Liver. Nerves...

n She falls to the ground, unmoving.
linebreak
para Oh. I-I can stop now, can't I?
para I can! *Sigh.* Finally.
hero And now that she's gone, you can let us out of here, right?
para But she was the one who controlled this place, wasn't she? And now she's dead. I... I don't like to think what that means for us.
n It means that you're stuck here. Forever.
hero Oh no. Oh no no no no *no.* Oh no I *hate* this!
n Time passes.
hero ... forever's going to... end... eventually, right?
n No. It won't. That's the whole point of "forever." It doesn't end.

n In her final moments, the Princess lunges forward, tackling you, and you both plunge into the endless abyss of her basement labyrinth.
n As the two of you fall, you rip your blade from her chest, tightly clutching it in your hands.
p Have fun falling forever! I'll see you when you finally decide to die.
n She tears herself away from you and tumbles away into the darkness.
n You are alone. And you are falling. Forever. But you saved the world. You should be proud of yourself for seeing this through.
para Oh. I-I can stop now, can't I?
para I can! *Sigh.* Finally.
hero Are, are we really gonna fall forever? Can't you narrate us some stairs out of here?
para But she was the one who controlled this place, wasn't she? And now she's dead. I... I don't like to think what that means for us.
n It means that you're falling. Forever.
hero Oh no. Oh no no no no *no.* Oh no I *hate* this!
n You continue to fall.
hero ... forever's going to... end... eventually, right?
n No. It won't. That's the whole point of "forever." It doesn't end. You continue to fall, and you will only continue to fall.
jumpanchor slayJoin
hero I feel sick.
para It doesn't *have* to be forever, though... does it?
hero ... what do you mean?
para We still have a way out clutched in our hands.
hero Are you suggesting we kill ourselves? Won't we be dead? ... I guess that hasn't stopped us before.
n That's a terrible idea. You've already saved the entire world from ruin, why would you want to die?
para Because right now, you don't want us to do that.
n You're right! I don't!
para But if we've already "saved the world" then why does it matter if we die? Why do you care?
n I just do! I value life. Every life. Even yours. *Especially* yours.
para *Why?*
hero What do you mean why? I think it's perfectly reasonable to value life.
n Exactly. I don't have to answer that.

para I don't like the way you said that. You *knew* this was a possibility, didn't you?
n Of course I did, though I'd rather hoped I was the first one. That explains a lot though.
hero Oh, you bastard. How much are you not telling us?
n Plenty. But it's all in your best interest. And the world's. And mine.

n It just can. Look, this world is saved, but if you "start over," for all you know you're just putting another world in danger. You barely managed to land the killing blow here. What if you don't manage it next time?
n *Sigh.* I've already said too much, really. You won't get another word out of me on the subject.

hero You say that now, but let's see how we all feel after a week or a month or a year...

para You really shouldn't have gotten rid of the blade. It was our way out! What were you *thinking?*
hero Now now, if we're going to be stuck here until we starve, we really shouldn't be at each other's throats.

jumpanchor stuckSlain
n I'm stuck here with you. I wish I weren't.
para Feeling's mutual.
hero At least we're all being honest!

jumpanchor lonelySlain
n Unlike you, I'm not *capable* of being lonely.
hero Aw, sure you are! Give it some time without us and I'm sure you'll start feeling lonely.

jumpanchor takeSlain
n You remove the blade from the Princess' body. What, exactly, are you planning on doing with it?

jumpanchor dropSlain
hero Oh no, what are you *doing?*
n You loosen your grip, and the blade tumbles through your open fingers. Now you're really falling forever. There's no way out now.

jumpanchor throwSlain
hero Oh no, what are you *doing?*
n You tighten your grip and fling the blade as hard as you can into the void. It's gone. Now you're really stuck here forever. There's no way out now.

linebreak
n Everything goes dark, and you die.

jumpanchor waitEndSlain
n You wait, and then you wait for a little while longer. But eventually the thirst sets in. And the hunger. The darkness of this place prevents you from wholly grasping the context of passing time, but that doesn't stop it from passing, nor does it stop your biology from unraveling.
n The only things you know for certain are that it's long, and that it hurts. The vastness of your suffering can't be adequately put into words.
para We really shouldn't have tossed the blade...
linebreak
n No, you really shouldn't have. But biology and time are immutable forces, and eventually, long before forever gets the chance to come, everything goes dark, and you die.

n Don't muck it up next time. The Princess may be slain here, but she isn't slain There.
