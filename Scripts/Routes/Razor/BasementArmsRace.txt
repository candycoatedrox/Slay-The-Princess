        hunted Thinking about dying makes us as good as dead. The only thing that matters is survival. /// checkvoice-para
cheated Actually, does survival matter? We've died twice and nothing bad has come of it. We just need to find a way to win once.
hero Nothing bad has come of it *yet.*
n Plenty bad has come of it! You've left at least one entire world to ruin. The people there mattered.
hunted The past isn't real. There's only here and now.
n Your internal bickering is cut short by the wet sound of slicing meat. From the Princess's arms erupt twin blades, glistening with her blood, the empty flesh of her arms flopping at her elbows like torn sleeves. The chain clatters to the floor.
n She's loose, and she is coming for you.
p You're going to make me walk over to you, aren't you?
cheated Shit, she's coming for us, and I'm out of ideas.

p Oooh. You're fast! But let's see how fast you really are.
    jumpto coldStubborn /// checkvoice-stubborn
n You dodge the Princess's blows for as long as you can, sustaining only nicks and cuts as you attempt to avoid her blades. But it isn't long before you're winded, your feet a little slower, your gait a little clumsier.
n That's all the opening she needs. She skewers you.
label coldJoin
p Gotcha!

label coldStubborn
n You and the Princess enter a quick and vicious exchange, each of you wounding the other, but neither landing a fatal blow.
stubborn Yes! Yes! This is exactly it!
n But the dance couldn't last forever. All it takes is a single clumsy moment. She skewers you.

hero I guess we have a weapon.

    broken She's going to kill us. /// checkvoice
    para This can't be the right answer. It's too easy! /// checkvoice
cheated Well, if we die, we die, right? Then we can try again next time.
    broken Bad idea. But it's not like any of you listen to me. /// checkvoice
    para Are you sure? /// checkvoice

cheated Yeah! No more moping, we're gonna fight her, and we're gonna win!
n Blade poised to strike, you charge the Princess.
p Oh, so you do want a fight, huh? Okay! Yes! I love this! Try to stab me! Try to stab me and see what happens!
hero Here goes... we can make this work.
hunted Yes. If we pay attention, we won't die.
    broken And what if we don't? /// checkvoice
    para Yeah. Mind over matter, mind over matter, mind over matter. What if we can't do this? /// checkvoice
n You and the Princess exchange a flurry of blows, and you manage to narrowly avoid death several times.
n Until you finally see it. An opening.
hunted It's a trick. Don't take it.
cheated No, screw that. Ours! Ours! I called it, it's ours and we're taking it!
n And you do take it. But as you close in, yet another blade erupts from the Princess. You have no time to react before you feel it sliding through your ribs.
hunted A trick. I knew it. I told you to be careful of tricks.
cheated What?! From where?
n From her knee, apparently.
p Hehehehe. Too slow!
cheated Oh that's bullshit! Bloody unfair!
n Unfortunately for the sake of the world, fair doesn't factor into this. Another of her blades comes slicing up to finish the job. She skewers you.

hero Ow.
p Ribbons! I'm going to make you ribbons! This is so much fun and I want to celebrate.

cheated She isn't one to talk and we shouldn't be either.
    stubborn I agree. Talking is boring. We should just get back to fighting her! /// checkvoice

    broken He's right. I don't think we can talk this out. I think she wants to kill us. /// checkvoice
    para Exactly. She wants us dead, you know! /// checkvoice

label oppoStabbing
p Nope! But I don't need anyone to tell me that. I know I'm good at what I do! The best, I think.
n The Princess pauses for a moment to further ponder your ill-placed compliment.
p Hey, what gives? Are you trying to get on my good side? You're not bored of me stabbing you, are you?

n You dodge and parry and dodge and parry in an endless repeating pattern, but you can only keep it up so long before making a mistake. The pattern breaks for just long enough.
n She skewers you.

label oppoStubborn
stubborn Now hit her back!
n You dodge and parry and strike and are struck, her nicking your flesh and you nicking her skin to reveal shining metal below. But eventually you slip up. You lose the pattern, just for a moment.
n A blade flashes through the air, and she skewers you.

label brokenMenu
n You throw your hands in the air and drop your blade.

n Now I've tolerated quite a bit from you, but this is a bridge too far. Please don't try romancing the Princess. She wants to kill you! She's going to end the world if you don't stop her.
