p And you still don't have a weapon! That's funny! That's a joke! I'm going to kill you now.
contra Yes, that was extremely silly of whoever did that. Probably a bad idea!
hero That was you!
contra I know! I'm just trying to add some levity to this.
cheated Well, since all of this was your idea, how about you figure out how to get us out of it?
contra Oh, guys like us don't get to make any decisions, you should know that.
cheated I decided to pick up that blade, and *you* decided to throw it out the window.
    broken This is why we've already lost. Can't even stop bickering with ourself. How are we supposed to beat her without a weapon? She's so sharp. /// checkvoice
    para I take it back. Having my own corner clearly isn't working because I can still hear you three yelling at each other. She's going to kill us again, you know. Especially if we keep fighting with ourself. We need to get rid of our thoughts. /// checkvoice
n Your internal bickering is cut short by the wet sound of slicing meat. From the Princess's arms erupt twin blades, glistening with her blood, the empty flesh of her arms flopping at her elbows like torn sleeves. The chain clatters to the floor.
p You're going to make me walk over to you, aren't you?
cheated All right, I'm out of ideas... What're we doing?

hero We're fighting her? Are you forgetting the part where the cheeky one thought it'd be funny to throw our only weapon out the window?
contra I mean, it *was* funny. Even she said it was funny.
cheated Oh, *yes!* It was absolutely *hilarious!*
contra We'll all be laughing together once we're out of here.
    broken If we make it out of here. But I don't know. That seems unlikely. /// checkvoice
    para Do any of us think we can hurt her like this? /// checkvoice

jumpanchor stubbornMaybe
contra Yes, exactly! Who knows what we're capable of? For all we know that "blade" was holding us back.

cheated *Sigh.* Okay, why not?
n Fists raised, you charge the Princess.
p Oh, so you do want a fight, huh? Okay! Hit me! Hit me and see what happens! I'll give you a free shot and everything!
hero Here goes... we can make this work.
    broken And what if we don't? /// checkvoice
    para Yeah. Mind over matter, mind over matter, mind over matter -- what if she's lying? What if she isn't going to give us a free shot? /// checkvoice
p Your fist slams into the Princess's face, and she recoils in pain.
cheated Huh. We actually did something to her!
p Ow ow ow ow ow! That hurt! What are your bones made of, metal?
p Because mine are.
n Before you can react, she returns a punch of her own, only it isn't really a "punch."
cheated Yes, we all know she has swords for arms. We have eyes.
n Well, she skewers you.

    broken *Can* we talk this out? I think she wants to kill us. /// checkvoice
    para Can we trust someone who wants us dead? /// checkvoice
cheated Exactly. I think she established that at some point between stabbing us to death and directly telling us, just now, that she was going to kill us.

jumpanchor oppoStabbing
p Nope! But I don't need anyone to tell me that. I know I'm good at what I do! The best, I think.
n The Princess pauses for a moment to further ponder your ill-placed compliment.
p Hey, what gives? Are you trying to get on my good side?

contra Is this what it's like dealing with me?
cheated Yeah, it is. You're the worst one of us. You know that, right?
    broken We're screwed. Again. I'll see you all when we die. /// checkvoice
        contra Really? I'm the worst one? Do you hear how whiny and un-fun *he* is? /// checkvoice-broken
    para Don't rank us! The last thing we need is to be arguing with ourselves while -- /// interrupt checkvoice
n But you never finish that argument before the Princess closes the distance.

contra Now *that* is an interesting move.
n Interesting? It's disgusting. No, don't try romancing the Princess. She wants to kill you! She's going to end the world if you don't stop her.
hero Yeah... do we have to flirt with the murderous monster?
contra Of course we do! I'm into it. The one making the decisions is into it. Are you not?
hero ... I don't think so? I don't know.
cheated I could go either way, honestly.
    broken She doesn't want us. /// checkvoice
        contra You're just saying that because you want her to be into you. /// checkvoice-broken
        broken I know. I thought I was being obvious. /// checkvoice
    para Maybe it'll work! Maybe it'll throw her off. I know I'd be thrown off if she started flirting with us. /// checkvoice

hero *The Look?*
contra Yeah. The best flirts know how to flirt without saying anything. We just have to let her know, right?

hero Panic where? Up the slide that dropped us down here?
p I'm coming to get you!
contra Nah, I'm with the decider. It defeats the whole point of panicking if we think about what we're doing, and I don't know if you've been listening, but she's coming to get us! So panic! Give in to the chaos!
broken Oh yes, the chaos of dying. How fun.
cheated Stop whining and do it!
